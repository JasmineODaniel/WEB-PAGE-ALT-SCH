                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Jasmine Daniel</strong></p>
                <p>I'm a Frontend & UX Engineer with a passion for building digital products that people love using. Alongside coding, I enjoy creating designs, from graphics to web apps, because I believe beauty and usability go hand in hand.</p>
                <p>I'm naturally curious. I love researching, reading blogs, exploring new ideas, and finding smarter ways to solve problems. I value human connection, so I enjoy meeting new people and learning from their journeys. For me, growth never stops, every day is an opportunity to learn something new.</p>

            <h2>Aspiration in Life</h2>
            <p>My biggest aspiration is to become a world class Software Engineer who creates solutions that make people's lives easier.</p>
            <p>But beyond tech, I also want to inspire young people: to show them they don't always need to have everything figured out, what they truly need is focus, internet access, direction, and the courage to start.</p>
            <p>I want to build a career that blends technology, creativity, and mentorship. I believe in growing while lifting others up. One day, I see myself speaking to large audiences, hosting bootcamps, and creating opportunities that will motivate the next generation to chase their dreams.</p>
